# Air Pollution and Health Outcomes in NYC

This project explores the impact of air pollution on public health outcomes in New York City neighborhoods. Using publicly available environmental and hospital data, we conducted a spatial and statistical analysis of PM2.5 and ozone exposure and its correlation with respiratory and cardiovascular health events.
